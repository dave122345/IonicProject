  <h2>facts about Curiosity</h2>
  <p>Curiosity is a car-sized rover designed to explore the crater Gale on Mars as part of NASA's Mars Science
    Laboratory mission
    (MSL). Curiosity was launched from Cape Canaveral on November 26, 2011, at 15:02 UTC and landed on Aeolis Palus
    inside
    Gale on Mars on August 6, 2012, 05:17 UTC. The Bradbury Landing site was less than 2.4 km (1.5 mi) from the center
    of the rover's touchdown target after a 560 million km (350 million mi) journey. The rover's goals include an
    investigation of the Martian climate and geology; assessment of whether the selected field site inside Gale has ever
    offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life, including investigation of the role of water; and
    planetary habitability studies in preparation for human exploration</p>

  <p>In December 2012, Curiosity's two-year mission was extended indefinitely, and on August 5, 2017, NASA celebrated
    the fifth
    anniversary of the Curiosity rover landing. The rover is still operational, and as of April 10, 2019, Curiosity has
    been on Mars for 2373 sols (2437 total days) since landing on August 6, 2012. It is one of two active missions on
    Mars with
    a new rover planned for 2020.</p>
